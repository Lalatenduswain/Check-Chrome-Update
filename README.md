# Check-Chrome-Update
This Bash script automates checking and updating Google Chrome to the latest stable version on Ubuntu systems. It compares your locally installed Chrome version with the latest version available from Google's repository, prompts for updates if a newer version exists, and handles installation via apt-get or direct .deb package download.
